# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **deleteTask tool** - Moves tasks to trash (soft delete) with mandatory user confirmation
- **deleteList tool** - Moves lists and all their tasks to trash (soft delete) with mandatory user confirmation
- Both deletion tools require explicit `user_confirmed=true` parameter to prevent accidental deletions
- Deletion tools are only available in `write` mode for safety

## [1.6.0] - 2025-11-25

### Added
- **Full markdown support for comments** - `addComment` now converts markdown to ClickUp's rich text format
- Comments now preserve formatting when reading back from ClickUp, including nested formatting

## [1.5.1] - 2025-10-02

### Changed
- The space resource now has a `ClickUp Space` suffix in the title.
- Add additional hints to all tools to potentially improve client handling.

### Added
- Added Icon to the manifest.json file.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-01

### Breaking Changes
- Replaced `writeDocument` tool with two focused tools for better clarity:
  - `updateDocumentPage`: Updates existing pages (requires doc_id and page_id)
  - `createDocumentOrPage`: Creates new documents or pages (uses space_id/list_id/doc_id)
- This change makes parameter requirements clearer and eliminates the confusion between creating and updating operations

### Fixed
- Fixed "my-todos" prompt failing with "Failed to get prompt" error in Claude Desktop by adding `prompts_generated: true` to manifest.json to declare runtime-generated prompts
- Fixed critical bug in document page updates: now uses correct ClickUp API v3 endpoint (`/workspaces/{teamId}/docs/{docId}/pages/{pageId}`) instead of incorrect endpoint that was causing 404 errors
- Fixed empty response handling in `updateDocumentPage` - now gracefully handles ClickUp API responses that don't return JSON body

### Removed
- Removed `searchDocuments` tool as it only searched document names/spaces, not content, which confused LLMs that are trained on fulltext searches. Documents can still be discovered via `searchSpaces` (which includes documents in space tree) or by direct URL.

### Changed
- Removed time entries from `searchTasks` results to improve reliability and prevent rate limit issues. Time entries are still available via `getTaskById` for individual tasks.
- Updated `readDocument` to reference new tool names (`updateDocumentPage` and `createDocumentOrPage`) in its suggestions

## [1.4.3] - 2025-09-26

### Fixed
- Add required `title` field to MCP space resources to comply with newer MCP specification

## [1.4.2] - 2025-09-23

### Added
- Task dependency and relationship management in `updateTask` tool (thanks @itinance)

### Fixed
- Strip inline base64 data URIs from `getTaskById` responses and surface them as proper image blocks instead of embedding them in text content

## [1.4.1] - 2025-08-31

### Fixed
- Fixed tag management in `updateTask` - tags are now properly added/removed using dedicated API endpoints (thanks @itinance)
- Fixed Claude Desktop dxt support. It had the word `cli` in the argument list which triggered the cli debug mode of this library.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-08-18

### Added
- MCP Resources support for dynamic ClickUp space discovery
  - Spaces now appear in Claude Desktop's resource dropdown for easy selection
  - Dynamic resource templates provide real-time space listing without server restart
  - Complete space tree structure with lists, folders, documents, and metadata
  - Resource URIs using `clickup://space/{spaceId}` format for consistent identification

## [1.3.2] - 2025-08-05

### Fixed
